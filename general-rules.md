# Queller Statments
- Any word written between asterisks, e.g. *threat*, refers to the glossary.
- The term Nazgûl excludes the Witch King.
- For statements which require a specific die to evaluate, the die you should consider to evaluate the statement will be given.
	- For example, the statment "Using a Character Die: An army can attack a Free People's army." is true if there is a Shadow army adjacent to a Free People's army and it contains a Nazgûl or Minion while "Using an Army Die: An army can attack a Free People's army." is true even if the army does not have a Nazgûl or Minion in it.

# Queller Actions
- Game rules override Queller’s actions e.g. it won’t carry out an action it doesn’t have a die for.
- Never carry out an action that would cause Queller to lose or miss an immediate win.
- Where Queller has multiple equally valid options use a die to select one at random.

# Moves
- Never move in a way that would create a *threat* unless the move decreases the distance to it. When evaluating a move statement, consider splitting an army to avoid this as long as the split force still contains enough army value to make the statment true.
- When moving from a region containing the Fellowship and the Fellowships progress do not reach Mordor,
   leave a Nazgûl and regular behind if eyes are in the hunt pool and the move criteria are still met. Ignore this rule when attacking.
- Consider both moves when evaluating true/false and priorities for an army die. If two moves combined can meet a condition, then the condition is true.

# Cards
- If Queller tries to perfom an action but is blocked by a card in play, Queller will carry out the requirements to remove it from play if possible.
- Use cards “in play” at the first opportunity.

# Characters
- Do not use a character’s ability if it would have no effect.

# Muster
- Where Isengard is the source of the primary and Saruman is in play, use Voice of Saruman.
  If Orthanc is under threat use upgrade, otherwise if 3 regulars available use muster.
  If there aren’t enough figures for either ability use, then muster as normal
