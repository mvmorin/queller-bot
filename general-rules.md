General Rules
# Actions
1. Game rules override Queller’s actions e.g. it won’t carry out an action it doesn’t have a die for.
2. Never carry out an action that would cause Queller to lose or miss an immediate win.
3. Where Queller has multiple equally valid options use a die to select one at random.

# Armies
4. Never move in a way that would create a threat unless the move decreases the distance to it. Split an
army to avoid this if the split force still contains enough army value to meet the action’s requirements.

6. When moving from a region containing the Fellowship, leave a Nazgûl and regular behind if eyes are in the hunt pool, the Fellowship’s progress places them outside Mordor, and the move criteria are still met. Ignore this rule when attacking.

9. Consider both moves when evaluating true/false and priorities for an army die. If two moves combined can meet a condition, then the condition is true.

# Battles
10. Remove Shadow units to support card play until the army would become passive.
11. The player must select and play their card before Queller.

# Cards
12. Use the relevant decision page for card play e.g. phase 3 hunt allocation for eyes, army for attacks, event/faction for choosing discards, etc.
14. If instructed by a card to remove enemy armies from a region go through the Army page as though a mobile army to select the region.
15. If a card is blocking Queller from carrying out an action it will carry out the requirements to remove it from play if possible. It will do this only if it tries to carry out the blocked action.
16. Use cards “in play” at the first opportunity.
18. Roll a die for “Fly, You Fools”. Queller loses on a 1.
19. When playing a Call to Battle card ignore initiative and select one at random from the valid options.

# Characters
20. In this document, the term Nazgûl excludes the Witch King.
21. Do not use a character’s ability if it would have no effect.

# Dice
22. If required to discard dice, do so at random from those not matching the preferred type.

# Muster
26. Where Isengard is the source of the primary and Saruman is in play, use Voice of Saruman.
If Orthanc is under threat use upgrade, otherwise if 3 regulars available use muster.
If there aren’t enough figures for either ability use, then muster as normal
