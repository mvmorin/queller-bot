The program will present a number of statements, selections, and
actions for each of the 5 game phases. Simply answer/perform these when
they are presented to you. Read the following general rules and have the
glossary available to help you interpret them.

program.

### Terminology
- Any word written between asterisks, e.g. \*threat\*, refers to the glossary.
- The term Nazgûl excludes the Witch King.

### Basics
- A statement can never be true if it would break a game rule.
- A statement is never true if carrying out the implied action would cause a
  Shadow loss or make it miss an immediate win.
- If you are presented with multiple equally valid options, use a die to select
  one at random.
- Statements may depend on which die that is currently considered. *Example*:
  `Using a Character Die: An army can attack a Free People's army.` is true
  if a Shadow army adjacent to a Free People's army *and* it contains a Nazgûl
  or Minion.

### Cards
- Use Shadow cards "in play" at the first opportunity.
- If a statement would be true if it weren't for a card in play, carry out the
  requirements to remove it from play if possible.

### Moves
- A move statement is not true if the move would create a \*threat\*, unless it
  also decrease the distance to said \*thread\*. An army can be split to avoid
  this, as long as the statement still is true for the now smaller army.
- For move statements using army dice, consider using both moves of the die.
  If two moves combined can make the statement true, then the condition is true.
  Prioritize using only one move.
- Special rule for moves out of a region containing the Fellowship, ignore it
  for statements regarding attacks.
	- If the Fellowship's progress do not reach Mordor and there are eyes in the
	  hunt pool, a Nazgûl and regular should always be left behind. The statment
	  still needs to be true for the smaller army that moves.

### Muster
- Special muster rule if Saruman is in play and Isengard is the source of the
  \*primary\*.
	- If units are available, use Voice of Saruman. If Orthanc is under threat,
	  upgrade to elites in Orthanc, othewise use the muster option.
