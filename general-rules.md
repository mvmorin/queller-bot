# Queller: War of the Ring Shadow AI CLI

---

The program will present a number of statements, selections, and
actions for each of the 5 game phases. Simply answer/perform these when
they are presented to you. Read the following general rules and have the
glossary available to help you interpret them.

Use the `help` command for more information regarding the operation of the
program.

### Basics
- Follow the game rules.
- A statement is never true if carrying out the implied action would cause a
  Shadow loss or make it miss an immediate win.
- If you are presented with multiple equally valid actions, use a die to select
  one at random.
- Statements may depend on a specific die. *Example*: For `Using a Character
  Die: An army can attack a Free People's army.` to be true, the army needs to
  contains a Nazgûl or Minion.
- For move and attack statements, it is the moving/attacking army that should
  satisfy the statement, ignore units left behind.

### Terminology
- Any word written between asterisks, e.g. `*threat*`, refers to the glossary.
- The term Nazgûl excludes the Witch King.

### Cards
- Use Shadow cards "in play" at the first opportunity.
- If a card "in play" prevents a statement from begin true, perform the
  necessary action to remove it from play if possible.

### Moves and Muster Special Rules
- A Shadow move should never create a `*threat*`, unless it also decrease the
  distance to said `*thread*`. Units can be left behind to avoid this.
- A Shadow army that moves out of a region containing the Fellowship should
  leave a Nazgûl and a regular behind if: the moving army is not attacking, the
  Fellowship's progress do not reach Mordor, and there are Eyes in the hunt pool.
- Use *The Voice of Saruman* if: Saurman is in play, Isengard is the source of
  the `*primary*` muster, and units are available. If Orthanc is under threat,
  upgrade to elites in Orthanc, othewise use the muster option.
